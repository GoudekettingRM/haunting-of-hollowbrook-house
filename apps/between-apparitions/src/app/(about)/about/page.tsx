          About me
        </h1>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          I started my research into the unknown back in the mid 90's. I was a young - but ambitious - anthropology
          student. During one of my classes I got introduced to the different beliefs people have. I felt in my bones
          that this was not always merely about belief.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          My first real paranormal investigation was in 1997 at the abandoned Blackwater Shipyard in Newport, Rhode
          Island. What started as an anthropological study of local maritime folklore turned into something far more
          profound. Workers had reported tools moving on their own and mysterious footsteps echoing through empty dry
          docks. I went in expecting to document how these stories reflected the community's relationship with its
          maritime heritage. Instead, I witnessed phenomena that couldn't be explained by cultural beliefs alone. When I
          recorded distinct footsteps in a sealed dry dock that hadn't been accessed in years, I realized I needed to
          expand my research beyond traditional anthropology.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          While I completed my anthropology degree, my focus shifted. I spent weekends investigating reported hauntings
          across New England, developing a more scientific approach to paranormal research. I've never wanted to
          monetize this work - keeping my day job has allowed me to maintain objectivity and research independence.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          Over the years, I've worked various jobs - museum curator, research assistant, even a brief stint as a high
          school teacher. But my passion has always been investigating the unexplained. I started this blog in 2001 to
          document my findings and connect with others in the field.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          In 2011, I came across the fascinating case of Hollowbrook House and its multiple disappearances. What started
          as casual research has evolved into a deep investigation that continues to this day. The more I uncover about
          the Hollowbrook mystery, the more convinced I become that we've barely scratched the surface of what really
          happened there.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          My research into Hollowbrook House eventually led me to accept a position at the Whispering Hollows Historical
          Society in 2013. While my paranormal investigations remain a personal pursuit, my work as a curator has given
          me valuable access to historical records and artifacts that help piece together the full story of what
          happened at Hollowbrook House. The intersection of historical fact and unexplained phenomena continues to
          fascinate me.

          This blog serves as a record of my investigations and a platform for sharing evidence with fellow researchers.
          While I maintain a skeptical approach, my experiences have taught me that some mysteries defy conventional
          explanation. I believe the truth lies somewhere between blind belief and rigid skepticism.
        </p>

          Feel free to reach out if you have questions or want to discuss any of the cases documented here. While I
          can't investigate every lead, I'm always interested in hearing about new phenomena that challenge our
          understanding of reality.
