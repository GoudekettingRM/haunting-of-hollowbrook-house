Rich paragraphs with chosen words
Hide secrets meant to be disturbed
In fives, the numbers hold their sway
Like clockwork marking time's display
The final pair holds secrets deep
One drops down, one sideways does leap
Once you reveal what is true
Enter it where search is due


Leads to: we are still alive
