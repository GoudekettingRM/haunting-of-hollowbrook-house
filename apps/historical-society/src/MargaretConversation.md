Margaret: "No, no, no, we've been doing it all wrong! The existing frequencies..."
Other Person: "What do you mean? The calculations seemed correct..."
M: "No, it's not the calculations, it's the frequencies themselves. Look at these readings from last night. They are basically non-existent."
O: "But those are the baseline frequencies we've been tracking for months. How could they be wrong?",
M: "What if they are not wrong, but just... incomplete? What if we've been looking at the wrong side of the equation?",
O: "You mean a 180-degree phase shift? But that would mean...",
M: "Exactly! That would mean that we've been canceling out the frequencies instead of amplifying them.",
O: "Hold on, let's check those numbers again. Are you saying all the previous attempts were actually interfering with the natural resonance?",
M: "Yes, exactly. We should actually use a 32 degree phase shift for the first, 147 degrees for the second, and 89 for the last.",
O: "And you mean to that we have always used the wrong settings for the frequencies? Destructively interfering with the natural resonance?",
M: "Yes, that's what I'm saying. We need to recalibrate the whole system. Everything. All three frequencies simultaneously.",
O: "Margaret, are you suggesting that everything we thought about the protocol was backward?",
M: "Yes, exactly. The meteorological conditions are still crucial, but we need to align with the natural frequencies, not overpower them.",
O: "The timing would have to be perfect. How could you possibly...?",
M: "If I'm right, the next attempt will be completely different. Instead of fighting the barrier, I'll be sliding right through it."
O: "This is starting to sound dangerous. Is there any way to test it before you try it for yourself?"


Margarets side:

M: "What if they are not wrong, but just... incomplete? What if we've been looking at the wrong side of the equation?",

M: "That would mean that we've been canceling out the frequencies instead of amplifying them.",

M: "Correct. We should actually use a 32 degree phase shift for the first, 147 degrees for the second, and 89 for the last.",
